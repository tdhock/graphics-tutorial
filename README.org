Publication-quality graphics for casual useRs

Note that if you are viewing this on github then there are several
broken links below. To fix that, clone the repository and execute
=make= (you will need R, pdflatex, and emacs).

** Motivation

There are many features in R that make it ideal for making
[[file:HOCKING-graphics-tutorial.pdf][publication-quality graphics such as the figures shown in this
sample PDF]]. However, many machine learning researchers are more
familiar with MATLAB than R.

In this tutorial, I will show how CSV data exported from MATLAB can be
read into R to make publication-quality graphics.

** Course outline (60 minutes)

First 20 minutes: installation of R ([[http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop][RStudio]], [[http://cran.ism.ac.jp/][CRAN]]), theory of error
bars. It is OK to not use error bars when you:
- Do not want to answer the comparison question: "are these two
  curves different?"
- Want to emphasize that one of the curves is NOT random (don't show
  error bands), but the others are (do show error bands).

Second 20 minutes: I will highlight the examples shown below.

Last 20 minutes: if you would like me to show you how to plot your own
data, please prepare a CSV file such as the ones shown.

| Plot                               | CSV            | Code                | with output            |
